# ONS Area hub pages

This repository contains the source code for the [Find facts and figures about areas in the United Kingdom](https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/areas/) pages (AKA "Area hub") on the ONS website.

The code is provided without warranty under an [Open Government Licence](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/) (v3).

## Using this code

The Area hub is a [Svelte Kit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) app, and requires NodeJS to be installed on your machine. You can run the code locally as follows:

1. Download or clone the contents of this repo to your local machine.
2. Install the Node dependencies by opening the folder running `npm install` from your command line.
3. Initialise the app by running `npm run dev`.
4. Preview the app in your browser by navigating to http://localhost:5173/.

Making changes to the app will require a working knowledge of Svelte Kit.

## Geography files

Each area that can be found within this app has a corresponding JSON file that contains its metadata.

The geography files are generated by [these scripts](https://github.com/onsvisual/geo-scripts) and hosted on Amazon S3 storage. For example, the JSON file for Hartlepool (GSS code E06000001) can be found at:
